To see what is existing, strategise about how to make it better and then see it through to action. It taught me the importance of maintaining a standard of excellence in your work and to be open to new and better ways to do something.</p>

				<p>In my role with Elevate Education I had the immense priviledge of presenting study skills seminars to high schoolers across Victoria. This job taught me how to prepare for presenations, to memorise speeches, make eye contact etc. But beyond the standard protocols, this job taught me how to listen, to really listen for what it is people are asking for and to be open and honest in your answers. Teenagers have little tolerence for what is fake and this job was an incredible opportunity to remain genuine despite high pressure.</p>
