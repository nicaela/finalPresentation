				<h3>Field Experience and Visits Coordinator</h3>
				<h4>September 2014 - April 2015</h4>
				<p>In my role at World Vision I was able to support the corporate, church and general public teams making trips to the field. During my time there I was tasked with creating and implementing a new personal fundraising strategy for each of the general participant trips. This job taught me how to implement a new process. To see what is existing, strategise about how to make it better and then see it through to action. It taught me the importance of maintaining a standard of excellence in your work and to be open to new and better ways to do something.</p>

				<h3>Brand Ambassador</h3>
				<h4>April 2014 - March 2015</h4>
				<p>With The Embassy I was ableto experience direct marketing to consumers for a variety of products including food, paint and kitchenware products. Was it humbling? Absolutely. But I think that's part of the purity of it. This job taught me the value of respect at every level and the reminder to remain humble, honest and hardworking in all situations.</p>

				<h3>Presenter</h3>
				<h4>January 2013 - January 2014</h4>
				<p>In my role with Elevate Education I had the immense priviledge of presenting study skills seminars to high schoolers across Victoria. This job taught me how to prepare for presenations, to memorise speeches, make eye contact etc. But beyond the standard protocols, this job taught me how to listen, to really listen for what it is people are asking for and to be open and honest in your answers. Teenagers have little tolerence for what is fake and this job was an incredible opportunity to remain genuine despite high pressure.</p>
